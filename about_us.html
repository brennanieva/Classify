    <h2>Why?<h2>
    <h4>
      <p> The ever-so-present link between organization and mental health is something that affects everyone every day; as organization improves, as does your mental health. Due to the recent rise in stress-related mental health issues in university students, we decided to create an app that reduces stress and makes life easier. What you do is difficult. Why not make how you organize it easier? That is why we created Classify<br>
      Classify is your go-to organizational app. Upon logging in, the viewer can customize the homepage that greets them and tells them the day’s weather. They can set their bedtime for reminders and even change their page’s display by using light and dark mode. On other pages, they can enter their to-do list and learn about what they prioritize in terms of their health.
